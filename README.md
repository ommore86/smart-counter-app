# 📊 Trackerly - Smart Counter
**Trackerly** is a powerful, beautiful, and user-friendly counter-tracking web app — perfect for tracking multiple goals, habits, values, or metrics all in one place.
Designed with interactive UI, dark mode support, undo-redo history, and optional progress tracking — it’s far beyond just a plus/minus counter!

## 💡 What it does:
You can:
- Create **multiple counters**, each with its own name and step value.
- Use **increment**, **decrement**, **reset**, **undo**, and **redo** for each counter.
- Enable **target progress tracking** optionally — and visualize progress with a dynamic progress bar.
- View **activity logs** of all actions in a collapsible sidebar.
- Enjoy the sleek and responsive UI with **dark mode toggle**.
- Easily manage your counters with **localStorage support** (auto-saves your counters).

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Habit or routine tracking (pushups, coding hours, water intake)
- Study or learning counters (pages read, topics done)
- Inventory or resource tracking
- General goal or target tracking with visual progress bars
